# Codex_Playground Snake Game

This repository contains a simple yet stylish Snake Game built with
[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/). The goal is to guide the snake around the
screen collecting food while avoiding collisions with your own body. Each piece
of food you eat will make the snake grow longer and increase your score.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Running the Game

Execute the game script using Python:

```bash
python snake_game.py
```

Use the arrow keys to control the snake. The game ends if the snake collides
with itself. Your score is displayed in the corner and on the game over screen.

## Files

- `snake_game.py` – Main game logic implemented with Pygame.
- `ENGINEERING.md` – Technical documentation describing how the game is
  organized.

Enjoy playing!
